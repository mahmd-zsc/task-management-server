## Introduction

Our backend serves as the backbone of our web application, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing. It provides RESTful APIs that the frontend can consume to perform various actions, such as user authentication, CRUD operations on resources like tasks or users, and more.

## Features

- User authentication (registration, login)
- CRUD operations for tasks and users
- Role-based access control
- Error handling
- Middleware for authentication and authorization

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for user authentication
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords
- **Joi**: Schema validation library
- **Helmet**: Middleware for securing HTTP headers
- **Cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file
